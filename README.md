# STM32 Projects with Proteus Simulation

This repository contains an STM32 project that includes a Proteus simulation for hardware testing and verification. The project is developed using 
HAL libraries and integrates with the Proteus simulation software.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `1-USART_Polling_IT_DMA_MODE/`: This project likely involves the implementation of USART (Universal Synchronous/Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) communication using polling, interrupt, or DMA (Direct Memory Access) mode.
- `2-TIMER Periodic IT _Counter_Output Compare MODE/`: This project appears to involve the utilization of a TIMER module to generate periodic interrupts and perform counter and output compare operations.
- `3-TIMER One-Pulse_PWM_Input Capture MODE:/`:This project involves the utilization of a TIMER module in the One-Pulse PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) Input Capture mode. In this mode, the TIMER is configured to capture the duration of a one-pulse signal and perform specific actions based on the captured value.
- `4-ADC Polling_IT_DMA/`: This project likely focuses on the ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter) module and its usage in either polling, interrupt-driven, or DMA mode.
- `5-Displays/`: This project  deals with different types of displays, such as LCD (Liquid Crystal Display).
- `6-SPI Polling IT DMA MODE/`: This project focuses on the utilization of the SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) module in various modes such as polling, interrupt-driven, and DMA (Direct Memory Access) mode.
- `7-SPI TC72 Temperature Sensor/`: This project focuses on the integration of an SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) module with the TC72 temperature sensor. The TC72 is a digital temperature sensor that communicates using the SPI protocol, providing accurate temperature measurements with high resolution.
- `8-SPI_MATRIX_7SEG/`: This project focuses on utilizing the SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) communication protocol to drive a matrix display or a 7-segment display
